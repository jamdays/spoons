# spoons
A simulation of spoons that I used to find out which strategy is better. My friend and I couldn't decide if we should collect 4 of the same card or a flush. I tested and it just depends on what the other people are playing and also where you are sitting. (of course this assumes that all of the players play exactly as the robots do). One cool thing is that it is better to collect 4 in a row if you are at the end. I hypothesize that this is because if you are at the end you know what the other players are not going to take, and if you take one of those cards then no one will hold on to those cards. And if you try to collect a flush you still may have an overlap with the people at the beginning. If I remember correctly the person at the end had the highest win rate along with the people at the beginning. I think it was better for the people at the beginning to collect a flush and the people at the end to collect four of the same. I don't remember exactly, I did this project a while ago. 

Yup, that's it. I did not comment very thorougly nor did I name my variables well, so it may be hard to read.
